Using zero-G manufacturing techniques that uniformly mix high-density steel with lower-density titanium and aluminum, the process produces a metal twice as strong per unit of weight as standard skeleton materials thus halving the weight of the chassis, but at an increase in overall bulk.\r\n\r\nAdd exactly <b>7</b> Endo-Steel slots to <b>half</b> your internal structure weight.",
